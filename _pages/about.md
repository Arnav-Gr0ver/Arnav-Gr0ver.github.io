## About Me 👋

Welcome! I’m **Arnav Grover**, a Computer Science student at **Purdue University** with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My primary research interests lie at the intersection of **machine learning**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, and **financial data analysis**. I’m passionate about leveraging these technologies to drive innovation in the fields of financial forecasting and economic modeling.

## Research Focus 🔍

My work centers on applying ML techniques to the financial domain, aiming to develop predictive models for market behavior and investment strategies. I’m particularly interested in exploring how **multimodal time series data** and **large language models (LLMs)** can be utilized to enhance decision-making processes in areas like private equity and risk management. My goal is to bridge the gap between data science and finance by creating tools that can extract meaningful insights from complex datasets.

## Current Projects & Interests 🚀

- **Open-Source Multimodal LLM Development**: Contributing to the creation of large language models that integrate multiple data types (text, audio, and visual) to enhance their understanding and generate more accurate predictions across diverse domains.
- **Modeling the Effects of Economic Policies**: Researching the impact of different economic policies using advanced machine learning techniques to simulate and predict their influence on market dynamics and financial stability.
- **Deep Tech Startup Ideation**: Conceptualizing innovative solutions that apply AI to streamline the due diligence process in private equity, ensuring data-driven insights and robust predictive capabilities.

## Academic Background 🎓

I am currently pursuing my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at Purdue, where I have focused on building a solid foundation in **AI/ML techniques** and **data analysis frameworks**. My academic journey is driven by a deep curiosity about how machine learning can transform data into actionable intelligence, especially within the highly dynamic financial sector.

## Beyond Academia 🌱

Outside of my research, I actively engage with the broader **tech community** through open-source contributions and collaborative projects. I’m also keen on following the latest advancements in **AI** and **data science**, and exploring how they can be applied to solve real-world problems.
